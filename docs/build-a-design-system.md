# Build a small design system

Build a **Button** and **Card** library in the desktop app, then use it in a second document with light and dark themes.

## Define the variables

Create a new file and save it as `starter.pen` in an empty folder. Open
**Variables** in the toolbar and add these variables:

| Name | Type | Value |
|------|------|-------|
| `surface` | Color | `#FFFFFF` |
| `ink` | Color | `#18181B` |
| `accent` | Color | `#2563EB` |
| `space` | Number | 16 |
| `font-body` | String | Inter |
| `font-size` | Number | 16 |

Use **+** beside the column headings to add a theme value. Rename the columns
**Light** and **Dark**. Set `surface` to `#18181B` and `ink` to `#FAFAFA` in
Dark. Keep the other values the same in both columns.

## Create the components

1. Create a frame named **Button**, 144 pixels wide and 48 pixels tall
2. Add a text layer named **Label** with the text **Continue** and a white fill
3. Set the frame's flex alignment to center the label horizontally and vertically
4. Apply `accent` to the frame's fill, and `font-body` and `font-size` to the label
5. Select the frame and click **Create Component**

Create a second frame named **Card**, 360 pixels wide, with vertical flex
layout and Hug Height. Apply `surface` to its fill and `space` to its gap
and padding. Add two text layers:

- **Title**: `Your next step`, using Inter at 24 pixels and `ink` for its fill
- **Detail**: `Choose an action below.`, using `font-body`, `font-size`, and `ink`

Turn **Card** into a component. Add an empty frame named **Actions** inside it,
48 pixels tall with Fill Width. Select **Actions**, click **Make slot**,
and use **+** beside **Slot** to suggest **Button**.

Save the file. Open **Libraries** and choose **Turn this file into a library**.
The resulting file is `starter.lib.pen`.

## Use the library

1. Create a second document and save it as `consumer.pen` in the same folder
2. Open **Libraries**, click **+** beside **No imported libraries**, and select `starter.lib.pen`
3. Open **Components** and click **Card** to insert an instance
4. Select its **Actions** slot and click **Button** under **Slot** in the properties panel
5. Change the instance's **Title** to **Ready to continue** and its button label to **Save**
6. Copy and paste the Card instance, then select the copy and choose **Theme → Add theme → Theme**, followed by **Dark**

The second Card has a dark background and light text. Both instances keep their
custom text. Save the document.

## Update the source

Open `starter.lib.pen`. In both theme columns, change `accent` to `#7C3AED`
and `font-size` to 18.

Save it, then close and reopen `consumer.pen`. Both buttons turn purple and
their labels grow. The labels still read **Save** because you overrode their text.

Keep both `.pen` files together when moving this design. If the consumer reports
a missing library, open **Libraries**, click the missing entry, and use
**Locate** to select `starter.lib.pen` in its new location.
Save the consumer after reconnecting the library.
